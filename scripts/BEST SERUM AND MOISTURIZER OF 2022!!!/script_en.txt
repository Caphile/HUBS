now 2019 is the best of 2016
Hi assalamualaikum warahmatullahi
wabarakatuh Welcome back to my channel
Welcome to Fatia best channel Don't get
bored after 7 years the entry words
keep going like this because I don't know anything else okay
Today I want to make this the 4th episode
yes, that means the best products of 2016
[Applause]
[Music]
or like what skincare I'm using that's
really suitable in 2022 which I
will definitely recommend to
you for hashtag
rationing.  -I
actually use the product in 2022, even if
you follow me every month,
there's a monthly favorite. These are
my favorite products, no, dude,
I'm going to taste it again and I've recorded it
here so I'm not wrong and I keep forgetting that
it's right for me yet  Of course
you are suitable and vice versa, so I
don't match, but of course you
don't match either. Because different skins have different
results, different skin types have
different results.
the sun 21 years ago You
can also watch it here so it's
really easy Okay I'll start right away I'll
start from Room of two thousand 2 I
swear this alone is noisy it's already
as tight as it is for those who watch Okay so
I might want to tell you guys
first disclaimer if  My skin is
now in 2022 No,
I think I'm starting to get to know
my skin better. It turns out that
my skin is a combination,
oily combination around my house. It's more
normal to drive skin and sensitive
skin.  in this part
I get red very easily or like
for example it's really easy suddenly
Breakout is very easy suddenly
blackheads and so on that I
feel Oh yeah this seems like one of the
signs maybe my skin is not strong enough
and my skin is just more sensitive
like that  the products turned out to be okay
here I divided them into three
categories of serum So the first one is
hydrating flush then there's something like
brightening and more like coming okay
okay we'll start from the hydrating
serum which turned out to be the most
compared to the other categories I
didn't realize I was  really
really love heronic acid and I'm also
really good with heric ice also
the term is when my skin is
okay, it's all kinds of things and so on, there's
only one serum that I'm going to
use,
that's why when we skin is
also dehydrated or more  dull again
Breakout and so on, maybe
our skin barrier is no longer
fragile, like now one of the
ingredients to strengthen the skin
barrier is also hydraulic acid,
that's why when our skin is moist,
it automatically flows between the skin between the
pores and so on  etc. It becomes
more moist and becomes more blended,
so the fine lines can also be
disguised by the skin that was dehydrated. It
can also become thicker, moist,
soft and moist, so it becomes moist, it becomes
moist again, and the term
skin problems are from things like
irritation and so on  it's
stronger, that's why I love it so much.
There are some of my favorites. Let's start with the
most expensive
but the best. Crazy, this is
from Langkom.  It's
like he's making a new product,
isn't he but he's more reformulating to make it
better better better
better like that now this is the
last one which means it's 2022,
yes the term I'm trying again I
really feel really quite a bit
different than
before  I feel like it's even
more moisturizing, it
soothes my skin even more, it
strengthens my skin barrier again, like
one Bottle does everything, in
my opinion, from the packaging, I
really love it, you just have to
squeeze it in digits and the texture is too light, it's
really easy to use and that's it
the type that I said earlier is the serum that
I like, it's the light one, I say, the
light one that absorbs the feel and
when it's absorbed it feels like
moisture like there's a layer on
the skin but not sticky like that
No Yes, it's like it's springy, it's like it's
springy like that  it's really bad, the
zibas hydrating people actually don't look like they're just
hydrating serums. Yes, I mean, it's like they
're not just focused on Hero, they're just given it. But in
my opinion, it really
moisturizes.  it's
fall, so it's still a bit cold
in the morning, use this, ah, it's great, then there's
this next. So, what's next,
if you're a mania, that's great, namely
from CK, this is
so this is one of the mild hydraulic acid serums,
actually, all of them are light, okay, these three.
What I'm mentioning is  these are the ones that are
both light and equally
delicious, both are moisturizing,
champion and when these three are
combined with other active ingredients, it's
really delicious or not good
because it has a light texture so when it's
mixed with other layered textures
it doesn't feel cloying  mostly
I mean basically these three I like Then
the second one which I really love is dead it
's arrived like the 5th mini bottle of
magic the original mineral botanica is also
moisturizing it feels really really really light it
gets really light but moist
one of the others in my opinion is the
lightest  the texture between the 3 earlier
is Azarin, this is Azarin X Marvel, the
hydramax water bank, this syrup is also
about to
finish.  it
absorbs the
lightest and then the next one which is
quite light too, mineral botanica,
this is the second lightest of the herex
acids that I have. Here is number 2, the lightest and
slightly thicker, but in
my opinion it's still really light
if you hold it in a new blend  I
feel like it's a bit thicker
than the other two, I like it.
There are 3 of these. Anyway, I think it's more about the
texture, which one do you need?  you
can use CK,
but of these three, the mineral
botanica has an addition, which in
my opinion moisturizes it like it sticks to
the moisture, it's more than the
other two, the mineral botanica, so it's
up to you which one you want,
but the best healer, in my opinion, is
one of the multifunctional serums  it can be
combined with other serums,
so the last one is a hydrating
serum as well but in my opinion what is it really called?  it
can't be
used every day they said it
can only be once a week or two weeks
like it's really really steaming hydration
on our skin, namely from the she Shadow
Ultimate future power shoot so at
that time I came to their launch event
so if I'm not mistaken it's
their 100 year anniversary  And they
took out this powershop like if
we take vitamins there are sharps like that, so
this is it. Yes, I
used it when my skin was really
dull and dry, it was very dehydrated
and I used it, it really got
straight the next day, it was supple and strong  it's
not dull anymore and it's not dry anymore, it's
really cool, the packaging
doesn't need to be used too much, it
doesn't run out like this, the
texture is again similar to
mine, does it become a little thick, but it's
moist, oh my God, it's really okay
the name also if there is a price there is a way yes
this is one in my opinion the one that has a
price there is a Rupee which is really hard on
my skin, this is really cool, it's
crazy but that was because he really has
powershop potential so you can't really
use it every day  I
use it once a week or two weeks
because I used it once before and I
immediately felt like that and it seemed like it
lasted about 2 weeks, I mean, it's
moist like the eyes.
I am to lighten
my acne scars because there are
still many of you who
ask me how to get rid of
acne scars, if for example
you still have acne, you
focus first on getting
rid of the
acne first.  some of the
products that I would really recommend to
you guys, the first is from the
same brand, there are two from you.
The first is you skin energy
facial serum, which is Brighton.
this is in the
middle of 2022
I really feel like the term
skincare routine that I do
really works to make my skin more
moisturised and more supple the
acne scars fade away is this factor
with mineral botanica
girls this is really good it's really bad I've
discussed this me  Like I said, it's
like Duo, it's really good, right,
because the term is for moisturizing
the skin, so there's Duplame, too,
so the term is really for
hydration, so this one has the one that fits
377, so this is to brighten it,
but it's still there to actually moisturize it too  the
original two are really really good
and the texture is also really
light but I don't know.
As I remember this one, the bottle has
changed, has it changed to
this one?
already the texture is light ouch oh God I
like the two combos for maybe
almost 3 months I didn't change anything
else it's just them and the
two of them I used the serum now
one more see you radiance up
antioxidant serum I said
377 too  he's there So to
brighten it even more there's Korean Camelia
extract and there's carnos too, it's
better, yes, the texture is also more liquid,
it's delicious, it's also really nice on my face.
I feel that my acne scars
are not decreasing as quickly as this one,
but moisturizing is really good,
like my skin is more
fresh, more moist, more supple, but at the
same time, the acne scars also
fade a bit, use this one, but if you
want this one  modern acne scars are
faster so use this one now this
last one I think After
all this time this brand has released
a lot of serum and I was like what
I don't think I want to
try it because there are so many serums
they release but there is one that
really my eyes  so it's like Ouch, I'm
really interested again, none other than
something, this is something
that is a diamond fighter or Vito stem cell,
this is really good, this is already the second bottle.
Swiss else theme sale and
for msk Diamond bright molecule, so this is
the term. The ingredients are
really good for brightening, but for me
personally it feels more like
reducing texture on the face but also
moisturizing and plumping my skin
too and brightening it, it's more like
fading acne scars, isn't it?
I think it makes a more tone up, imagine what
this means, I
really like the texture, I really like it. The color is blue, it's really from the
color of fruit extract, if I'm not mistaken, it's
original, the texture isn't
too runny, but it's not thick, it's
still really comfortable  For example, if
I use it in the morning, I don't need
it to layer with others.
-the line also fades and continues to be
supple too, right? Automatically, I'll get permission too right,
if the rice is the same Charity tea, right, right, right?  it's
also good I like
one of them I think it's like something
serum What I use is the other 2022
I'm used to just using this I
mean what I finally tried is like that
This is really good now one more thing
is Actually it's not a serum but
it's already been  Flush oil, which is from
Oasis, is already the third bottle that I
use, Oasi Oceanus, the quality of the mix sport
correcting face oil syrup, Ahui is great.  I'm afraid the
humidity is wrong but basically it's
like making him slowly
absorb it and that makes him more
hydrated
I really like it really bad the texture is
really light but we can feel
the oil too right when you see it boy it's
really runny Well me too in
2022  it's very rare to give birth to a
lot of serum, that's a
maximum of two and even then when
I feel my skin is
healthy again, if for example my skin is
a bit breakout or how can I just stick
to the basic Skin Care, now this one is
when I'm feeling my skin  it's
good again Okay but I want a little
more hydration too but for
Spot correcting it's also
really good because earlier because it fits right in the
hand it's light and liquid but when you get here
you will feel the
oil so the oil gives
moisture  on your skin in a more
like that Yes, after that we
lock the hydration using the moisturizer
and sleep the next day supple I love I
really love it and trading acid is also for
brightening the skin, OK, this skolin is
to calm the skin, uh, it's great,
anyway, it's the same  one serum that
I really like really badly for calming the
skin when I'm on a breakout or like a
skin so that I'm damaged again irritated
there's one thing that I also didn't
think I would love, namely
blessing of sprout and rich,
when I was feeling it, yes, I
said it was like there was  If you have a rash or
irritation, for example, it's
reddish like that. What I use is
the hydric acid serum, one of which I
mentioned to him or I still really
use the rhx mix,
I still use it, well, these are
both to calm it down, it's
really great  really good moisture
and as you know
Spark or like the bean sprouts it's
really good for the skin to soothe the
skin moisturizing the skin because it's
quite high in antioxidants too and
plus what I like is actually the
texture it's quite a bit thick
that's what makes me  use it at
night to give more hydration to the
skin like that,
husband, it's really good, the smell is
really unique, you know hygiene, you like it really like it
and that was best 22 now
let's go on to the best moisturizer on
time
OK, next we go on to the best
moisturizer on
2020  original, actually I said earlier that
in 2021 there are still a lot of things that
I like that I use in 2022
but there are also many in 2002 that
recently entered Indonesia, to be more
precise, all of them are local, there's only one
that isn't local, let's start
with the first  At most, I report Chase
many times, if I'm exaggerating, it's
nothing but if you've been following me for a long time, I'm
sure you know, right, on IG I expect or
on tiktok, I've said it a lot,
so what do you see?
yes, in 2022 this is
one of the most viral moisturizers in
my opinion in 2022 which I got to like
the first time I haven't bought it yet I feel
like it's really gimmicky I swear I think it's a
gimmick like the term you understand
or not, it's like it keeps making a scene, okay,
it's normal, right?  It's like I'm lazy to buy it
like that, understand or not, then I bought it, I'm
also lazy, I'm gay, right?
a moisturizer with a texture
that best fits
my moisturizer criteria, because
its texture is moisture gel,
so it's Jell, it's not the gel type, it's
that light, for example, if
we have dry skin, it doesn't look like it does
n't look like that, doesn't it have just the right
consistency?  It's already
half as well, it doesn't look
like this, the texture and right in the Blend it
really gives moisture, it's
really delicious, really bad, and it's
not sticky at all and I
always really use it before using
makeup.
I always
tell you, for example, if
our makeup wants to last long, one of the
keys is the right Skin Care.
The right skin care isn't like
using a lot, but the product
is right for your skin type.
The product is also the right amount,
like for example  earlier, this is the
moisture gel, it's not too
sticky but it doesn't really
feel moist, it also makes
our skin moist and supple enough,
which makes our makeup last
longer because it sticks like
skin. That's how it is and added like
What you know is that I have arthritis, it is
to strengthen the skin barrier,
can you imagine what I said earlier
because my skin is dry to sensitive skin,
what I need is to strengthen the skin
barrier too.
I also
really feel every time I use this when
my skin is irritated or red
or you guys can have bumps and it
has a texture it really soothes my skin
Value plus plus plus plus
plus a million plus for real TV skin Oh
BTW I left he has a size  the
big one also makes me like
Ouch, you're really smart again, this is 30 grams.
If I want to go around, there's a
big one for a while. Well, he finally found
this 80 gram fix, so this is definitely
already in this house.  I want to
travel, use this one and the
next one is my champion.  it's all the same, yeah, it's a
Duo, actually it's been around for quite a while,
but I really tried and
finished up to two cubes in
2022 and it turns out that I love
him that much even though the price is quite expensive But
I think it's worth every penny, the texture is
thicker like this  a little bit right when I use it but
I really feel like it immediately
soothes my skin which is
reddish here and like
my texture. If I use this
the next day,
the texture is less
original.  to provide the
retinol content or for example from the
nice night content which is excited and so
on, no.
skin like that, so
morsery is used to lock
everything to lock hydration like that I
really like this color it's about to run out
too Huh next I have a
product that I use when my skin
is dry or dehydrated or
needs suppleness  super duper duper and
this is the only moisturizer that
I bring or I'm going in autumn
when I'm back in Europe nothing but the
best collaboration collaboration between
Dufa and Hans Daniels
Oh my God it's really good the
price is pretty good, it's around 3400
I forgot  but I've really
used it up, it's really
gone completely because I turned out to be
as good as this product I
want to educate a little too
for you guys, if for example you go
abroad or to an area where the
season is different from the same  in us, it's
tropical, I really
advise you to change
your skincare routine according to the
conditions or like the season in that
country or like in that city.  the
feel is like that, the weather I
bring with me a skincare routine that is
very, very hydrating which if I
use it in tropical Indonesia like this
it will definitely make me bleber which
makes me even more breakouts and
pimples and blackheads because it's
too thick but I know myself
because I'm also a bit dry and a bit
dehydrated too I need a
thick thick one that's really hydrating which
I use there one of them is
this one I've used here
and I feel how come it seems too
thick for me but we I use
there I  I can't go any other way, besides
using it, it's really good, the texture is really
bad, sorry, I ca
n't show you how to get it, the texture is
more
like creamy cream.
also it's a bit thick but
over time it absorbs and
gives essential moisture to
our faces and we feel like secure secure
hydration like that really like it the smell is really
good too and the next thing every
time I use it it's supple and it's healthy and
the skin is fresh and it's also plum like that huh
And as for reducing acne scars
and so on, I again
said moisturizer is more hydrating,
actually. Try reading it first, I
kind of forgot,
anyway, I'll tell you the details
here.
want to be supple ah love
next is from local as well this is
the only multifunctional Skin Care
that I recommend for you
because I also just discovered this In
2022 it's in Mira superfood skin
juice which has glow Booster they have two
if I'm not mistaken Glow Booster is the same for
acne and this is for you the type of
person who is lazy.  it's really really bad Ouch
like this I remove my
make up first like really using what's
called micellar water or not
cleansing oil so it's
rinsed off quickly or if for example I
really can't say when I wake up
from sleep I'm like using micellar
water but really-  right until it's
really clean after that I spray it with Dalba
or use any facial spray and then I
overwrite it can I sleep I've tried just three steps.
konci like sit
Serma
also brightens, moisturizes the skin
and helps strengthen the skin barrier, of course, that's
the packaging.  it has a
soft glow and strong skin
barrier, I've been trying it to be
a tester,
I really like it, really like it. Well,
there's one last moisturizer
locally, actually I know
from my friend Tasya Said, she
really likes this product,
and I'm actually a bit  I'm confused
because it says Sleeping Mask
but when I tried it I really liked the
texture again I didn't imagine
sleeping masks often do this because
usually when sleeping mas it's a bit
thick and has a bit of a layer It turns out
it's not from dorskin
matcha Glow Dream Mask Okay  So, as
the name suggests, it's actually a sleeping
mask, but you can use the call to prayer moisturizer
too or you want to use sleeping mas.
It's also a bit thicker to use
tomorrow morning.
Like this, the green color I'm a bit
annoyed with the packaging because it
likes to come out of the packaging.  it's just like that, just like that,
but
the writing is good, delete Brighton and moisturize
skin. It's true, the color is green, but do
n't worry, it's not green later, when it's
blended, the texture is original. I
really like it.  I often use it
at night because the texture is
quite thicker than all the
sentri I mentioned and if for example
I really need to move again I
prefer layering actually so it's
like in layer 1 layer it's a little
dry I run it again after that I run the second one
sleeping like that If for example you
want to make it Mas it's also really safe it's
delicious and the smell is also really good
and the color is nice green Anyway it looks
like it has green tea like that No
but it's true
[Music] [
Applause]
Oh my God
I can't wait for tomorrow-
I'm heading to make up tomorrow, I
hope this video is useful, that's the
most important thing, because I
let you just let me
be the victim of trying
new products in Indonesia, right?
Yes, and as usual, please poison
me to try products  -products that
I have never tried, please
comment below and what else to say
See you at the best products of 2016
bye Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi
wabarakatuh
everyone Okay, guys, I'm back.
Thank you very much
for voting, we will also discuss the
best of 2020. In your opinion, there are the top 3,
the first is something,
I'm not surprised that it
won because something
really seems like that much, it really
makes serum to be honest, it's at a stage
like  I'm confused about which one to use.
For example, maybe some of
you are really suitable for
something serum. Please comment below,
what should I really
try that I've never tried?  the
serum is good for those of
you who are beginners who are just beginners
in skincare because what it contains is
very what, isn't it different then
it's also light too and in my opinion it
can be used more for that one
from teenagers too maybe from
many that can be used by pregnant women  there's also
a lot of spark plugs that can be used like that, so that's
why I think there are so many
advertisements for something like this as
their favorite because it's really firstyle
and so it also has a fairly
light texture that absorbs easily, that's why in
my opinion it's a plus point for
something even though it's actually
a lot really bad but  Yes, it suits me
personally. Personally, I will
always like
something, and the new Diamond is the
same as Hbha. I also like it.  it's
too
how-how do I use it too, it's
my top, so now the top
is Avoskin.
But in my opinion there are
also quite a lot of them around 12.10 that's all
I've discussed in full
you can see here later I'll
put it in the description box too I
think the content is really
good and in my opinion it's
a bit more content than
something So  for example, in
my opinion, if you want to advance a little more,
and if you're looking for a serum with a
slightly thicker texture,
you should buy Avoskin, which is your skin B
because it has a thicker texture, more
like there's a layer of skin on it, but
it absorbs well, but it's still light, in
my opinion it's still  light and something,
right? Then the top 3 is Azarin
again, it's no wonder, it's really really good,
Azarin and 33, I really
like it, it's really good, it's also one of the serums,
which is really light, the quality is
really good, in my opinion, but
I really think I'm the same
This something is quite similar, it's suitable
for those of you whose skin has
just tried using serum or using
Skin Care and especially for those of you who just
want to try acting gradient, I
'll agree to try Azarin
or something like that. He has 12
too, right?
Marvel, in my opinion, is really good
and easy to remember, he has
stubbornness too, and when
we see it's quite clear from
the explanation, for example, for me, Hydramax
is a header for moisturizing, some are for
coming and so
on, so from the naming, it
's clear. Oh  if the mission of this room
is hydraulic S to moisturize
like that for example there is also retino
like that it's clear in my opinion that
was the eee serum of student according to
you guys now we go to the base according to
you too this is top 3
top 3 the first is skin TV  none other than it's
proven to be true, that's
what I first called the
best moisturizer in 2022,
indeed Words the high was the viral work.  The
quality of the TV skin
is really good, the price is a little
more precise, yes, in terms of shape and
size, but what is it really worth, is it
worth the ingredients, like really really
good quality,
so I'm not hesitating, I'm not surprised to
always buy it and always use it, it's
great  Then the second one is something,
I'm not surprised either because
more or less it has
uses or ingredients and like
claims that are actually similar to skin TV,
the only difference is that from me personally I
really like something in the
form of the packaging  the packaging is
very hygienic because you live
in a pump, so even though it's pretty good, it's
smaller, and it also
has refills too, so
the term is from innovation,
something is really better, like that in terms of
packaging and so on, but
from  the content is more or less the same and
to soothe the skin as well as me
personally, I
use it quite often on skin TV like I still
use skin TV more often because the
next third review is
be you ex
tre Thank you for choosing XD I
really didn't expect  I really
saw it
Even though it was last year and it's
like I really always
use it even now
actually I still really use it when
I feel the need like a sedative like
I know for sure you won't have any
problems on my skin it's a
USB CD  It's read moisturizer so
I also think for those of you who are easier to
get bruises it's easier eee sensitive
I really recommend that at UX it's seen as
a moisturizer especially now that
there's even bigger packaging and
the price if I'm not mistaken It doesn't
change the price but the size  it's
bigger and the quality is
definitely good
[Music]
Thank you, thank you very much for supporting
Bioxdia, thank you very much anyway. For
supporting whatever I make, I'm
touched,
that's the best serum and moisturizer of
you. See you in the next video
[Music]
