Hi assalamualaikum warahmatullahi
wabarakatuh Welcome back to my channel
welcome to
channel BTW happy
fasting, God, this really doesn't
feel at all,
okay?
Guidance and hopefully we will continue
to be better people okay
now because it's already
April I forgot it's already April
when I always make monthly
febris and now it's time for Mark 2 in 2020
thank you this time actually I
also feel that there aren't too many
meaningful products  on the one hand it's also
really good meaning I use it
all the time but interestingly there are some
items that I rarely mention
when I'm on Matly it's here so I'll get
straight to it
[Music]
Disclaimer first sponsor the video if for
example my skin suits you guys
it doesn't suit, right, different skin, different
results, say, different references are also
different, that's how it feels, right? So let
's start with this, like by care, there is skin care, there is make up.
This I really randomly bought from Kak Cafe
that's this ee her name is Anna
pellets right not getting hit with pellets instead of Anna
pellets peach foaming body scrub so I
bought it at KKP Because when I was going to
Singapore again there was an event with benefits and
benefits tend to be  It's more like
pink, right? I think I want to make
content, ah, shower in a bathtub, right?
While like a body scrub, after that it's like
soaking in a bath. I just bought
the best booms too, from Kak Cafe and
I saw this, how come it's really cute,
like pink?  Then the name is
foaming body scrub when I use it
I really like it so it has a body
scrub like a normal body scrub, like a normal body scrub,
it's peach in color too peach and when you
use it, it's like a regular scrub
when you add water it foams and all the things
called foaming body scrub  so in
my opinion, for example, if you
run out like scraban, you don't need to
use soap anymore because it's already foamy. What
I like too, the money smells really good, it smells
peachy.  and it's distributed by PPK
cafe kids I like the fragrance if from
the granules it's not really harsh
but it's not that it doesn't taste so it's
in the middle so I like
next we go to random first, which
is
this place for medicines so it's like
medicine storage I feel  it
turns out that I really need it
because there are quite a lot of vitamin supplements
that I really drink in a day and
I tend to forget that I don't make it
like this with him like this
Usually I eat it in the morning,
it's simple right away,
even though it's a bit messy because it's
quite big, I can't do something like
one drink, it's brought like that, I can't, that's
it.  Indonesia must be compressed, that's for sure.
with
mouth glasses again like Duh
really cute that's the brand is gentle
monster I bought this in Singapore and
the term is that in Singapore people
really understand you gentle monster glasses
like that all Indonesians who go to
Singapore go back and forth I'll definitely buy the
monster gender and I'll give it a promo
Astaghfirullahalazim  So I bought it.
At first I wanted to buy the Jackie one, which is
like this, actually, when it comes to
shape, it's not much different from this, but
when I tried it, how come it's Jacky?  Cell
lo Cell I feel that he frames
my face more because he has a
slightly square shape and he
has a frame here, for example,
Jack's one is a bit bloated, and
a little round again, so it has
two points, and Jeki has two points.  3 here,
I've never bought a monster
at all, this is the first time a
male monster, what are the sun glasses that I
bought and I think Oh yeah, I understand, I
think they're black, it's
really dark, they have
several choices.  there are black ones, there are
gray ones, there are ones that also look like they have
leopard ones, that's how it looks like brown-brown, you
know, yeah, it's brown like that, but the
black is identical, like
their signature, the really black one, and it looks
like there's a little bit of the logo here
What's really special about him is that he continues to
hold him on the Farm, so for the price,
it's pretty good, but after I
had a look and I also chatted
with Ms. They also have something like a
lifetime warranty.
maybe this is a
plus Why do people end up buying
gentle monsters like that?
Two, I think out of all the years that
I used it, there are two. There are two that
I really like. The name is Kiss
X, Vina Gracia, the Aurora, so Vina is a
collaboration. There are two, there is the Aurora, there is one
that looks like a crescent moon.  it's just
unique, like
that, the middle is brown on the outside, it's
like purple-gray like that. So when you wear it, it's
really pretty, so I'll show you
a picture of it when I use it and a
lot of people like to ask if, for example,
I use this, what do I use, he
uses sicum xpinagasia, it's the same  the
last one is
jejulan's collaboration with avion. at that time I made it when I
tried a new product. For
example, here, if you want to watch it
in full, it's actually one of the
contact lenses that might not be my type
because the diameter is quite big, but when
I use it, I feel that the color
suits me because  it's brown but the chocolate
still sticks to the chocolate, it's like
shell chocolate, actually it's brown, it's
more yellow brown, for example, but when it fits
my eyes it's still good, and
when the diameter is quite big, I do
n't think it's that weird, isn't it
like Ouch, it's really different, isn't it,
but like  Yes, it's cuter,
because my eyeballs are brown,
so there are more bunders,
I like these two,
actually I've been using these two for a
few months, not just a month
ago,
I'll recommend that we go to Skincare
first, Skin Care  I'm currently liking this.
Well, that's how it is and I'm alhamdulillah I really
got the opportunity to become a
representative for Indonesia to take part in the
regional launching of this benefit eee
Asia and India in Singapore, maybe
I'll show you a few
snippets of it Oh philosopher, thank you
so much for believing in me like I
didn't really expect it I'm right  -It's been a really
long time since I've worked with a
brand to go abroad and it's like that, it's
like that, so it's
like
[Music]
is wrong Thanks for giving me
overtunity like this, sorry, let's go back
to their product.  There are
3 types,
there are really Deep Plants,
there is a purple color. Then there are those that are
really for Titanium Force or
yellow, and there are blue ones,
like for smooth, like for
moisturizing, win, etc. BTW
I also want to really appreciate it  the packaging is the same as the
packaging, it's
really cute, it's really cute, it's really like
this, noh, it's adorable,
you know, the color is uh, it's yellow,
right?  it really
cleans all the dirt and every
time I use it first it smells
really good second it cleans it up it's also
really good like it's not too
greasy and when it's been cleaned
doesn't it still have oil left
or doesn't have a mat like that I
like Then the second one is me  I like it and in
my opinion this is one of the
most unique innovations I've ever tried so far
this toner but
[Music]
it forms into a form but the toner I swear I'm
surprised or not I was right at first it was like
this facial wash how about No it's
toner but the shape is just right for me  wondering
why you made it form like that,
right? Then from research it's proven that it
turns out that if the texture is foam it
will absorb more easily into the skin so the
particles are smaller and
really absorb into the skin so I
really like this one because it's pha so
it's pretty exfoliating toner but it's
really light to use at night on me
personally I feel more like
cleansing and like lifting Not
only does it remove dirt but it's like it's
lifting my sebum every time I use
this it's like it's just right like
this Oh what kind of thing does it look like  It's like
my pores are clean like that
every time I use it so I
really like it. I forgot to explain
earlier. Before that, there was a good clean
pharmacy foaming cleanser. This
is their facial wash. So if
this one was the foamy one, it's the
toner. This is a facial.
Their wash is a foaming cleanser. I also like
it. Actually, this is why I like it too
because it fits the criteria. If
I'm looking for a cleanser, the texture of the
gel doesn't need too much.
moist skin
Usually when we wash our face Yes, it's
more to Well, it's neutral,
sometimes it's not even dry,
I'm even confused, this makes
my skin moist from washing my face.
Over there in Singapore, I
really fell in love with the mask.
Hands down, this purple one
is pret for cleaning Clay Mask
and the other one is Speedy Smooth 2.
I tried the right and left, the
right and the left, the one that was treated
because of smooth spilis  and I feel it's
really really
soft when I've rinsed it I
really
tried right and left How come this one is
really really soft and it's only
used for 5 minutes is enough while
for this one I really like it it really
seems to suck up your neck
lol because of this, it
looks like a Clay Mask. Here's how
I use it, so it's slime, use it
and then it'll look like there are
oil spots sucking in, and then it's super
satisfying.
I use
him I really love the two masks
apart from that it's really good and I
really admit it from all of this, yes
From all the orange They are one of the things that
I would really recommend to you guys
is the mask because in my opinion
it's that good and easy
to clean up huh  I really think
that from HP packaging,
why is it like this chasing like
this?
Because in my opinion it's
more hygienic
that you can use
facial wash as well. I
really like the last one, smooth
shift light with smoothing moisturizer
Force.
it's quite moist,
a bit from the texture of the finish, so it's
quite moist, a little thicker, a little thicker
than eee moisturizer. I usually
like it, but if you guys have
dry or dehydrated skin, I think
this is one of the champions, like for giving
extra moisture quickly. Sorry,
I explained everything.  because
in my opinion it's really worth buying Okay
next it's just these eyes I really like
using this called propolis
if you know this happened
really bad on social media because it's
actually a Smartwatch but if you
use it it will come out like a crust
from your mouth  and our poop is like that,
like earlier, the sink is
like that, you know, but I've never bought it
because it's really expensive,
Rp. 300,000 the big size is
like that, right?  I
feel like he's really cleaning it like
removing all the dirt and plaque from
my mouth like that. So when I rinse my
mouth, it really does have
black spots, though I
think it also depends on
our oral hygiene, if for example we know it's
dirty like that, it'll be black like that  but
for example, if it's not, it's like it's a bit
ordinary, so the color is But in my
personal opinion the results of the review and I tried it I
think I don't think it's used every day
Because I think it's a bit
hard like that There's a fear that it will
actually take too much dirt from
our mouths  you know,
maybe Emil has teeth or what,
I also don't know, I'm just making it up,
but I mean I feel like
he's getting better.  I don't
run out of the small ones Okay, then
we'll move on to make up BTW I'm
really sorry if I can't
give an example of makeup today because
I just had treatment at the clinic, it's a
shame I just had
treatment using make up right away but there are
some  what I might try is
like that lip balm cream and so on The
eye part still looks okay
I want to poison you first with a
liquid pump Yes you are right Liquid
balm I really like these three
colors and in my opinion all three
are right  -It's really usable, oh God, it
has a name,
Liquid Bang, yeah, it's true, these 3 colors look
like Marble, it's really pretty, oh my
God, look at this one.
like that,
this is my really favorite color for the
Topper of all kinds of lip cream that
I'm currently using, the empty one is
one for seven, like
this, the color is the same as the last one, it usually
becomes a topper when I'm wearing ombrean,
so make it on the  in the middle or so the
color is a bit red, number 37 is
really pretty and not only is
the color really pretty, it actually has
moisture too and it also has
a little Hands of Light, the dream makes it
feel fresher like that, my favorite
is number 117, I'll use it now for
you  you can see, it's
like immediately the lines of the
closed lips are really interesting, bomb but
Liquid in terms of texture, I can
say that if you want to imagine it, it's
like a Lip Gloss, it's a bit thick, but
after a while because it's a bomb, it absorbs into the
lips and then there's just
one  Another product that I like
is the benefit, which is floratin.
and
more, yeah, I'm not, I'm not like that, right?
it doesn't
make him line or it doesn't
look like it's uneven sometimes he likes to have cracks like that,
right?  just
like the lips, but healthier,
fresher, a bit pinker case, so
yesterday I added a little on
top of it,
so it's a little more glossy,
because the floratin one
doesn't gloss, it
absorbs after a while, this is what's
for  maintain the gloss like
this, I
like it, okay, so next one,
there's a complexion product. What
I use many times I always
seem really good again and this is local
from Sika. I made one brand
makeup tutorial here. You can
just watch it and I fell right away.  I
really love it, it's really good. From
the texture of the finish, it has a
blur effect too and lasts a long time. Also,
the color fits my skin really well.
This is called
attention of you, your easy Blend the ball
light weight moisturizer.
yesterday's obmt
I felt that it was a bit different
from the claim they called it that way,
because the writing was so I
imagined it was tinted, right? The
moisturizer that usually tends
to be not too coverage, you know,
but this cover is high, the
texture is runny, but
the texture is high  I really think this
balloon is just one neck, that's enough, I'm
sure you'll see, you already understand that I like
me, it's medium. By the way,
look, it's runny. Let's look at the
moisturizer. Usually, it tends to be a
bit thicker, like a moisturizer, but
that's okay, okay?
Coy, from the feeling, I really like
it, it's runny, but I feel like it really
has moisture, which I put on my face,
that's how my son uses the color, it's just right, the
medium one, and when he
's set the finish, I also like it,
not matte, but not too
glowing  it's also like healthy skin just
like that, I like it really really really
really Really I
think that from the packaging
it's quite heavy from the glass the thing is
so if I want to go around it's a bit
heavy but when I go to Singapore at an
event I'll use it next  This
is the makeup that I bought right in
Japan which I finally use again at
this time especially for Spot
concealing because sometimes I
feel like I've used a complexion product
or for example I'm not using
foundation but I really want to focus on
covering acne scars like that  yes, I'm
currently using it and I think,
why is this so high, oh my gosh, from
the Shadow Spot cover foundation,
I will recommend it for those of you who,
for example, are going to Japan and like to make
up, really like full make
up, that's full  coverage makeup, try the one
I'm using, the color h100 like
this, the color actually looks like a cream
foundation, there's a lot of it locally,
actually because at that time I recommended a lot of people
from Japan to buy this.
it's absorbent like that, at that time
I was able to try on makeup, you
see, the result is matte, so it
looks like it really absorbs right
into the skin, the value is really a plus. Even though
I think it's a cream foundation, the
cream foundation is a bit tricky
because usually it runs a bit -  Running like that is a
bit creamy, right, but apparently it's not, it's
definitely used and it
immediately sticks to my skin.
My favorite blush was last month,
in fact, I discussed the product
exactly last month, but I
don't feel like I want to shut it out. It's more
special specifically for these two products. Because
I use it very often and
it makes my face fresher.
The
pink one, right? And from beauty, the name
is happy. It
turns out that I really like the
color so bad. At the beginning of the neon,
I was scared too
[Music],
it's really good.
blush powder from
blp which is the color of a bikini
like
this is really good for what
good quality and I'm also as good as what it is
and it's mirrored so yeah,
we just trusted it.
That's right, it's
neon, it's a bit peachy pink, plus this
pink one still has a little bit of move on it.
So when you put it together, it's a little muted,
but it's still bright, it's still bright, you see,
most of it on the cheeks.
use blush pink but
okay continue with this I also have one
esselash Contour bronzer which I personally also
rarely use Contour and bronzer
but I really like it let's try it again
with Contour it seems like it's been too
long I haven't used Contour bronzer
anymore until  finally found him at
that time I bought in Japan actually
it was Romance like this I
immediately Uh I like this one because it's
not too dark in color it's also
really easy to blend on layers it's
really good I'm the color 04 Here it's like
this it also has a brush  it's just that
I rarely use the brush so I
really like it I really like it for the
nose contour. The color is
also right for the contour.  I want to
give an example, starting with not the colors
that are too far away but we'd
rather not be too far away
but can be layered or
stacked like that until it meets
our needs, don't be too heavy, it will
look older,
the color is really thin, but that's it  him he
Why do you give shading on the face like that
for the color too I really like
the selection not too Cool gray
but not a warm one like
newcare brown color The Perfect one for
shading and like browsing Yes I
really like it Next time we go to
Eyebrow  yes, there's Eyebrow Oh my gosh,
this is on snows monster video I swear no,
but I'm still liking it again, more precisely,
this benefit, which is precisely my broken
pencil, so yeah, you guys, if you've been
following and liking beauty, it's been a long time,
you won't be surprised why
the benefits are so great  -very famous for
Eyebrow production because it's really good
Indeed, in my opinion, the
benefit is one of the pioneers who
makes Eyebrow pencils with
lots of colors just after they run out,
other brands make it like that, do you understand it or not,
so for Eyebrow, it's
always been beneficial  using top of my mind
is also a benefit like that. I
used the shade 4.5 and it turned out to be
just right, the color is not too dark but
not too dark, look at this,
what makes me fall in love again and
always fall in love with this benefit
because  It's like I've tried a lot of
products, right?  it's
not easy to
break but it's creamy but it's not
too creamy how come and I can
tell you why this is really good. One
of the ways, eh, the value is
that here I'm actually a bit bald, yeah
I always really continue my eyebrows.
I use an eyebrow pencil on the outside.
For example, the eyebrow pencil isn't
good, it won't blend with
my eyebrows and it doesn't seem like it's gone, it's not that
good, listen,
look at it in terms of color, in terms of
blending, in terms of cream minus,
that's what it's like, the consistency, the texture,
it blends really, really well
on the eyebrows I can see I
really love it Okay look at this I'm a bit bald
on the outside
and look at it it's
really good okay one more product
from benefit that I like because this is
their newest product which is the
slave up brawx
browser that was me too  I really really like it
that's one of my first Berau Karas
that I felt grinded I can't
live without using him I swear it's
really good he recites moving my eyebrows like they're
sticking stay uh sticking okay
this is really good now from the Indonesian products
that I read this is it  it's not as strong as the one that was
obtained by the browser
but it's enough to give a
feder effect like Buser eyebrows like that,
right?
after a while it's clear, it looks like that
and the hair is small so it's
really easy to use and later I'll show
you the position on top makes Gusion look cute like that
I really like this and
I like this too even though he judges
passionate but not like  it's really stiff
like Kanebo it's not that dry
and even if you want to clean it it's
still easier to see It doesn't look like right away It's
really neat
for those of you who have
long thick messy eyebrows Ouch I like it I'm sure
the next one is eyeliner I just
realized that I haven't mentioned it before
this and it goes into my favorite from avion, the
name is avion I styler power proof
eyeliner, in my opinion, this is a
jet black eyeliner,
I really like it and it's true, I
had a chat from the very beginning.
I want to make this Si Avenue, what is
your favorite product?  he said
this then I tried it again it was really good
then I forgot that it turned out to be
really good and I forgot to tell
you how good the packaging was, yeah it's just
like that uh but don't
just the book I'll give you a look  yes,
it's pitch black and a sign that I love
it, apart from being jet black, it doesn't blend
in our pores, doesn't it, doesn't it
absorb easily?  That's it, right, right
when it's dry, it's already waterproof,
Smartfren Unimed, friend, let me
make a little here, it's
just a little, right, you can also want it to be
small, thin, want to be thick, that's
it.
I'll give you a look, the
last name. Oh, here's another tool.
from Japan actually it's
an eyelash comb that really helps
me actually helps me because it's
hygienic, that is, it's closed
because usually when it's sold it's like
this, it's
like if there's mascara,
right, if that's the case,
right?  It's hygienic
first, right? I've used mascara,
sometimes I like to clamp it, sometimes I
like it to be uneven, like it's sticking to
each other, just use a mirror.
You look at it, comb it again, guys,
or not from the bottom up, so and
then go to go.  just like that. Try it
now, I want to use mascara.
I'm already using eyebrows. I
don't use mascara.
the eyelashes are done
and don't forget to clean them up
again
