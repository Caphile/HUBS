Hi assalamualaikum warahmatullahi
wabarakatuh Welcome back to my channel
I'm really excited because it's been a long time since I
haven't discussed a brand and
its products, do you understand
[Applause]
Whatever and today I want to discuss
a local brand that
really caught my attention from its packaging  and
the price and contents, which contain quite a lot of
250, cost only Rp. 100,000.
There is also a bundle, hmm, just go ahead,
let's go, let's go
ready, the local brand name that we will
discuss today is and allowing
[Applause]
Why is satellite  really because I want to
tell you the packaging, yes,
one, two, three
Yes, please
[Music]
I swear the color is really tempting,
isn't this because for
you the type of person who buys any
fragrance because of the packaging, I'm sure
you will buy it anyway  the term,
you guys are more concerned about the packaging, fix it,
buy this one, look at this, there are
stubborn three of them, look at this, it's really cute, I swear.  the
packaging is called
body Splash body spray body mess
actually it's the same as EDC or
you can say uh the kolong so
this column is a fragrance with the
lightest concentration of
about 2 to 4% more
alcohol content but usually
this is more for freshness  or like
more for that, body Splash,
like that, looks legit, I can imagine what it
means, that's why. Usually, like
body mist, body Splash, body spray or
EDC, what does it most like give
freshness when you've taken a shower, right?
So, it's
fresh, right? You guys will
really like it like body Splash body spray
or from a machine like that, right?
For
example, it's like perfume, it tends to be
okay.
-set
using Body Splash, okay, one by one I
will discuss the fragrances and later
at the end I will also choose
my favorite fragrance, I hope it will be useful for
you so you know that, OK? Which one do
you want to buy?
the price is Rp. 100,000,
so they have something like the stubborn one, the
recalcitrant package, there are three recalcitrant
and five recalcitrant, for example, a recalcitrant
five is like this, the variant
is this one, the price is
400,000, the contents are 5.
for example, this one, these three
with this variant, the price is
Allahu Akbar, the price is
250,000.
or Eid hampers,
there are three stubborn ones
like you, even more luxurious. You can
buy stubborn ones. 5 I'm sure you will accept it
like uh Wow Fatiah really loves
me like that, right, like that,
okay, ready, okay, let's discuss one by one
first  Yes, starting from the stubborn five,
okay, let's start with the packaging first.
I want to talk about the price of Rp. 100,000, which
contains 250 ml of packaging.
that's
right and it's really like Yes, it's a verb like that and
then it sprays even though it's a
lid, if it's to be Anas, it's closed, so it's just a
plastic lid, it's normal and it continues
to spray Let's try it, oh
for a while it's
still smooth I like it If
I may give a little advice  this is
their name, it's in their tag. So
if for example this is taken off, I
already
don't know what this is called.  So this is really a shame,
try to have the writing under here, that's all
like
here, okay, the fragrance is
vanilla drinks.
I'm really surprised, I just realized
when it smells good, but it
contains Vera extract, which means
there's Skin Care that can moisturize, right?
Okay, vanilla dreams,
I'm reading
it.
size fresh Pineapple and Pier
and also the middle note is
Rose geranium Lily all the Valley and
based on it are
t-rex and vanilla accords
This is the first time I've picked up this
note.
macem I'll just spray it on paper
okay so let's just kiss it there Okay let
's try spraying it
Using it is
fresh but it's also sweet because earlier it
turned out that it was diagnosed that there was
blackcur in it, but it's coming soon
because there's Pineapple and pear,
basically this is for those of you who like
the smell a bit sweet but want it to be
fresh too and not tacky at
all, this is vanilla  Dream, I think it
smells really good, I put it in
my favorite first because it's the first, right?
fresh
Lily and the base notes are sandalwood
Amber and vanilla I guess it
smells good at the beginning I bought it fresh like it was fresh what it is, yeah it's
fresh okay I'm sorry
if I'm a bit like this cribing
the sense like that but I can imagine if
for example it's delicious like that  okay,
there's sweetness, but
really, I'm not lying, these are the only
two I've smelled, but this smells, to be
honest, it's not like what I imagined, it's
called body mist, body splash, body
spray or the colong
that I've tried, you know what I
mean, I can imagine
This is the first time you smell it, it smells
like perfume. At first, it
's just that because the alcohol content is
higher, so yeah, it does
n't last long on the body, but you
know what I mean, it really tastes good, right,
like the smell needs to smell like
perfume at the start
[Music]
This is really a first impression.
The third is Candy
Rush. If you finish candy candy,
I think it's usually sweet. If
this Candy, the top note is lemon.
Crush melon and red Apple. Then the mi
download is sweet Kelly and
failed and base.  the sweet party is a
course and Mask. Okay, uh, it's really interesting.  I'm
also in love with
candy rice,
I also thought it would be
really citrusy, but it still seemed like
there was sweetness in it too, and it
turns out that it's because there's melon,
so I smell
good.  melon, this
melon smells
lovely, I think it smells unique
because it smells like melon, first
impression is like the top note, it
has melon, so it's sweet,
the next melon is this blue one. Uh, I
think the
masculine fragrance is Midnight blue.
I don't know, I
haven't read Midnight blue, which means I'm
guessing it
smells more like there is Mas
Klin, so
maybe there's wood or it's a bit musty
too.
and
contouring, it's true that there's a
bit of sweetness too, sure, yes,
and the notch of the sandal wood and ember.
So actually, if maybe someone
doesn't know, right?
we kiss
it and then drink it and then drink it
afterwards and Based it's like
dry down so when it's absorbed it's
already mixed with our skin ee
our body temperature smells good on our body it
's a fragrance that will really stick to
it what's like that
I hope this is useful  the blue value
means he's a bit sweet but there's a bit of a hint
right? This is a bit masculine. Audrey
might like
this.  he's Black Palm too, he
said that, but I do
n't think it's even that black because it's even
masculine, that's the color you like to smell
like, sir, that's what you like, sir, because it
smells weird. Well, he
likes the unique ones, Audrey.  The
last one is really delicious.
Uh I love the name. The name is red
velvet.
This sweet cake is black current and orange, and in
the middle, the
base is dark vanilla and white
gold.
At home,
try Red Velvet, to be honest, what
smells isn't blackcurrent and orange,
but I think there's spices like this, it's
a bit Toba, but why
don't
you try it, right?
like that or maybe it's Dark vanilla
I don't know either but this looks a bit
Toba I understand or not I understand this
like the types who like to smell good understand
that way it's going to
smell good like more I mean I
personally had a bit of Taba
how come or the mangroves are in a good way,
aren't they like Toba? If you smell like
cigarettes or not, but like there's
a bit of Hands of tobacco, right when
you smell it, but it's really interesting, the
smell is really unisex, in my opinion,
this one is really unisex.  it can be
used for guys as well. The
first three before,
actually, before asking for blue. In
my opinion, the first three
have a pretty feminine side to them, but
for the two that were, I think they are
unisex, they are cool too, okay,
okay, let's continue.  to the recalcitrant which
contains three of these and I just realized the
recalcitrant three of them He's the color there is the
ombre one this ombre from green to purple
this one Uncle it's from blue to I'm
going to go purple too huh Eh where is
this one Oh yes this is true  from yellow to
green, so I think these three are different,
maybe they are specialists or not, anyway,
these three are the ombre packaging.
Let's try the first one. Aurora light,
wow,
I already have a bit of an image.
where is New Zealand, you
saw Aurora, right?
I've never been there,
maybe after smelling it, you can
imagine it's like going there, Aurora Lights,
the top notes are in a different size
press, Pineapple and Tear, the top
notes are exactly the same  The
first one was vanilla dreams, but
the difference is that this one is bergamote, the
black current back, there's more of a
Russian one, what's it called
kaffir lime
?
then the middle notes are
Rose geranium Merry nude and mu I what's the
build here then the base has
gold uh Jasmine and bucket uh this
smells quite interesting, I can't
imagine a little when I mixed it like
that it ended up coming here and getting there
which means it's like getting here I
feel like Oh people are
really smart like performers
can imagine what the smell is like I don't think you
understand or not You keep getting mixed up
so that's how it's great great great great
Oh great Okay
this is sitrusive but he's there  It's bitter like that. It's
actually really different from the
first three, it's really like
fresh citrus clean, that's it, now for
this, I can imagine that this is a
fragrance that you are very familiar with,
so it's like Oh, if it's right,
my ex said this is just right  the
first time you spray it, it looks like a perfume, it
doesn't smell like it's
random, but it's quite a
familiar fragrance that you often smell like that, in
my opinion, the next one is
tiu, which is yellow to green Rainy Days. Okay,
that means it's raining in
broad daylight.  Days, yeah,
he's uh,
very interesting, lemon Flame and shaderwood, the
top notes are in the middle, there's
Rose, just me And what do you, yeah, and you can
see this is gold bucket and rush,
Berry, Oh, it's interesting,
there's raspberry. Usually, for example,
base  it's more like calm,
like even though it's Amber, right? Well, that's the
Dairy brush on the best.
Usually when I smell a lot of perfume
like that, do you please help coffee? Please
coffee, now this is because
it's fresh, so I don't taste that good
Okay, let's try this.  the
smell is
exactly the same as if you're eating
lemon strep candy, no.
Hands down, I swear because I really like it.
Try Hands down, it's exactly like
strepsils lemon.
no this is really good
it's really fresh but I
can't imagine I'm going to take a shower
using this but I mean it's a fragrance
that reminds me of
lemon strepsil fresh really fresh like that
sometimes it smells good not only because we
like the smell like that you know but it smells
like  makes us remember taking
pictures
makes us remember the
memories that happened, for example,
reduce your ex like this
all the time. You guys are
confused, okay, the last one is
masky,
maybe it's more unisex, yes, it's
cleaner, but it's more like that  yes it should be yes and
he is oh very interesting the top notes
are fire and citrus types then in the
middle there is orange blossom
Jasmine only there is honey also then at the
base later there is Mask and sandalwood
really interesting in the middle there is a
handycam there is also honey on it  at first
there was tea
I like this it smells like clean tea ugh
I like Teteh but it's fresh but it's fresh too
because there's a website too but it looks
like it has a mask like that and it's
called Mas Kiki but I
think I said earlier that's why I was
first impression but I  it's also not really
really me, if you want to
try something, it's not like you know if you
've tried something like that, it's
like I'm surprised it's really Body
Splash Wich, it has a column that really
looks like a refresher, but the smell
isn't random, you know it or not  I'm going to think
about him I swear
but I swear this really
smells really good Okay, I've tried the
88 I can immediately choose the
fragrance I like the most but I'll
try again one more time after it's
dry, right? It's been a few minutes.
I'm trying we're going to try again one more time
and I'll make sure okay okay
I'll choose the top 3 and I'm
really not going to continue to use this
like
the first one there's nothing that isn't
love at the first time the first time I
kissed it fell right off  I really love the
vanilla dreams, they are
really delicious, they smell sweet but they are fresh
but they seem
really good, the leaves are also really good, the
dry down is still like
calm but there is a little sweetness,
even the sweetness isn't really
gone a bit.  but like a
soft nose like this it's delicious I like it I
really like this one Even though I personally don't really like
vanilla it really
smells like vanilla but here it is thin the
vanilla has a little sweetness but there are more
other fragrances that join the mix
makes this so unique and smells
really good No, I'm not lying, it
's actually not really delicious, it's really good, it's really
good to collect Rp. 100,000
guys like when you take a shower like that
the second thing is you can guess if you can't use it you
can't you can't The
second is Midnight blue  here it is I
really like it earlier because earlier I said
it smells like sex but it's fresh but it's
calm but it's a bit gahar but it's cool like
that basically these are the types if
for example I want to take a shower at night it's like I
need it like I'm cool like that but
I want to sleep now this  imagine I want
to use this, do you understand or not this is
really delicious and then it drys again and
again the blender so I'm still
really good it's wood and bucket sandals like that
and the last one is my top 3, I've
already Hands down from all of these I have
chosen for sure  the last thing I
tried to be really surprised was the mas
check it smells like tea but the dry down is
still really good this is really good the
smell is unique like it's not clear this
Uni smells like tea but it's unique after that
it still looks like it tends to stick to the body  It
sticks even more like that,
even though it was already under it or for
example it's body splashbadi spray,
it actually lasts one
to two, yes, three hours is the maximum, but the
Energen agent all depends on your
skin, maybe if for example
you want it to smell a
little bit more  it takes a long time every time you
want to spray the money, whatever it is, you
try to use body lotion first. So it's
like for example, if you use body lotion
on the parts that you want to
spray, the method is here or here, and
then after you spray it,
it will make much more money  it lasts longer that
much if you what's your favorite you
can't have this one This is my
red, I usually use Audrey, I
really like this one because what I
said earlier, it smells like it suddenly smells
like you know the meatballs like that
I love it Oh, yeah, it's a skill  That's all,
right, from the bottom of my heart,
in my opinion, this is
one of the Body Splash, which has a unique fragrance.
100,000 contains 250 ml You
can also buy stubborn three stubborn 5 want to buy
all of them too I support because it
smells really good, because guys, that's all,
my video, I hope it's
useful, please at least
try one, I'm not lying.
yes
if you like it ok see you
in the next video and yes
